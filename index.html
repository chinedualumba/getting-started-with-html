<h1>Some key concepts</h1>
<b>Firstly: How the web works.</b>
 <p> Learned about the communication between <b>computers</b>,
 <b>servers</b> and <b>web browsers</b>. How opening a web page sends a <b>HTTP Request</b>
 to a <b>server</b> which in
 turn finds the appropriate <b>HTML document</b> for that page,
 sends it back to the computer and is tranlated into
 the page we see by the web browsers we have e.g <em>Chrome</em>, 
 <em>Firefox</em> and if you're a really 
 patient person, <em>Internet Explorer</em>
 </p>
 <p> The <b>HTML Document</b> is made of several things: Text content that we see on the page,
 <b>HTML Markup</b> 
 which edits how the page
 looks, References to images and videos, and even links to other pages.
 </p>
 <b>Secondly: How HTML Documents are created</b>
 <p>HTML documents are made of HTML <b>elements</b>. When
  writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML <b>tags</b>.
  </p>
<p> Making text look different is one part of what <em>HTML Markup</em> is all about. 
<em>HTML Markup</em>  consists of tags that appear in brackets like these < > - opening bracket
and having a "/" -
in the closing bracket ends that element. Several different tags
make the text in the document look differently. 
</p>
<p>Examples are putting a "b" or an "em" in the tiny brackets. The first one makes everything
in between the opening and closing bracket <b>bold</b> while the
second one writes everything in <em>italics</em>.
</p>
<p>Some tags are <b>inline tags</b> while some are <b>block tags</b>. <b>Inline tag</b>
ends a line and starts the next words 
on a different line. While <b>Block tags</b> create an invisible block around the text.
Pretty cool stuff and 
the further we go, the more I hope to learn more information that I can share.
